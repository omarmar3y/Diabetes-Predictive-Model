# Diabetes-Predictive-Model

* Using kaggle diabetes dataset I created predictive model
* first cleaned and explored the data 
* created some features (feature engineering)
* prepared the data for creating ML models then created multiple model pipelines for easier grid search for pipelines steps hyperparameters 
* combined the best models in the hyperparameter space i searched in ensemble model
* permutation to interpret the model ( Logistic regression ) feature importance
