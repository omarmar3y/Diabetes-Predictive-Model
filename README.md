# Diabetes-Predictive-Model
---
Diabetes is one of most common chronic disease that lead to many complications on the long run if not managed well and early detection protect from have high blood glucose for long time as the most people discover they have diabetes when their blood glucose level reached high concentration that lead to keto acidosis which is very dangerous

* Using kaggle diabetes dataset I created predictive model
* first cleaned and explored the data 
* created some features (feature engineering)
* prepared the data for creating ML models then created multiple model pipelines for easier grid search for pipelines steps hyperparameters 
* combined the best models in the hyperparameter space i searched in ensemble model
* permutation to interpret the model ( Logistic regression ) feature importance
